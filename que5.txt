5] Find the output and write explanation?
class Main1 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int t;
		System.out.println("Value of variable t:"+t);
	}
}

o/p:
The  output of the program showing one error at the time compilation that is the variable t might not have been initialized. This is due to for accessing any type of data values it must be initialized at the time of variable declaration.
