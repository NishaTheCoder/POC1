class Test1 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		byte b = 127;
		++b;
		b++;
		System.out.println("Value of variable b:"+b);
	}
}
O/P-Value of variable b:-127

The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and maximum value of 127. So in above program byte b is initialized with value 127 and after increment ++b it’s value become -127 because 127 is the last value so after increment it goes to -127.
